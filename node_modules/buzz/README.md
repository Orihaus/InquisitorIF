Buzz, a Javascript HTML5 Audio library
======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/buzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/buzz)
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

Buzz is a small but powerful Javascript library that allows you to easily take advantage of the new HTML5 audio element. It tries to degrade properly on non-modern browsers.

```javascript
var mySound = new buzz.sound("/sounds/myfile", {
    formats: [ "ogg", "mp3", "aac" ]
});

mySound.play()
    .fadeIn()
    .loop()
    .bind("timeupdate", function () {
        document.querySelector("#timer").innerHTML = buzz.toTimer(this.getTime());
    });
```
